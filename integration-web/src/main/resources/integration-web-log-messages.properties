integration.web.cannot.find.host = Cannot lookup hostname for IP address: {0}.
integration.web.cannot.find.host.solution = This may not be an actual problem.\n This Integration Bridge instance is \
  configured to allow webhook requests from specific hosts for this type of integration: {0}.\n This warning message \
  indicates that the Integration Bridge cannot convert the indicated IP address to its hostname in order to verify it \
  against the hosts whitelist.\n Check the indicated IP address and verify if it is associated to a hostname \
  indicated in the whitelist of originating hosts for the integration.\nIf that is the case, check the DNS services at \
  the Integration Bridge host machine and verify the reason why the given IP cannot be converted to the its hostname.\n
integration.web.request.blocked = Webhook request has been blocked because it is coming from an unauthorized host. \
  Originating host address info: {0}.
integration.web.request.blocked.solution = This Integration Bridge instance is configured to allow webhook requests \
  from specific hosts for this type of integration: {0}.\nCheck if the indicated IP's belong to authorized hosts and \
  if so, update the IP/host whitelist for the integration (check Integration Bridge deployment instructions for \
  information on how to do that).\nIf the indicated IP does not belong to an authorized host, this warning may \
  indicate that an external system is trying to post spoof messages through the Integration Bridge. If there is a high \
  number of warnings of this type, it is worth analysing the indicated IP's from an IT security standpoint.
